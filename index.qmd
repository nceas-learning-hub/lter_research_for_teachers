## NCEAS Expertise

The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has 30 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals. Together with the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER Network) we are excited to pass along skills, workflows, mindsets learned throughout the years through the _Authentic Research Experience for Teachers_ program.

## Setup for course: get the software!

[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17zfnxxpscKeH4WATWhYP4v--aFZwk-xJvZV7vQmrg2Y/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.611fw7rg8qj9) to install the needed software and get an account on GitHub.  We'll set these up later, but the basic installation is pretty straightforward.

* **Git** version control software
* **GitHub** web-based version control system
* **R** statistical software
* **RStudio** software to make it easier to work with R (an _integrated development environment_ or _IDE_)
